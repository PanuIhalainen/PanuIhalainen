## Hi there 👋
I’m new here and excited to start sharing my learning journey and projects here on GitHub! 

- 🔭 *I currently work* in a cardboard packaging factory. 
- 🌱 *I started my studies* at LAB University of Applied Sciences in the fall of 2025. I'm interested in information and communication technology, and I want to learn extensively about coding and other IT services.  


- ⚡*Fun fact*:  know some sign language.
